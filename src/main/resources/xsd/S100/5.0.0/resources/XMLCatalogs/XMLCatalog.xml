Document history
Version 4.0.0-20200326	2020-03-26	Raphael Malyankar for NOAA
    Initial sample, prepared for use with S-100 4.0.0 generic schemas (FINAL) dated December 2018 and/or
    updated in May 2019. Maps broken ISO URLs for ISO 19136 and ISO 19139 schemas to the new locations on
    the ISO standards web site.
    Updated 22-Oct-2021 for 2021 ISO schemas by adding a rewrite for the path to the gmw files encoded in the
    ISO package from the ISO TC211 GitHub as of 18-Oct-2021.

    2022-06-20: Updated for S-100 5.0.0, including references to schemas.isotc211.org

<!-- Note:
     See the OASIS XML catalog standard for information on other kinds of rewrite rules. Report any
     other broken links in either the S-100 generic schemas or the ISO schemas used by them to Raphael.
     This file is an example and you must customize it for your local installation by replacing the value
     of "rewritePrefix" to point to your own installation folder.
